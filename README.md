# Awesome File Server Is Awesome With UI And Stuff #

## Can haz!

Liek dis...

1. get virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/

2. get docker https://www.docker.com/

3. Den make sure you gots http://boot2docker.io/ if u **mac** Bro!

When ya got dem down like that, then you to this like a boss:

`$ boot2docker init -s 8000` 

Coz, you know, that configures the VM to have a 8gb limit, coz like, the default is like 20gig you kno i'm sayin?

Start that motherfucker up and do what it says if it pukes on you, can't always get it right the first time, lurn!

`$ boot2docker start` 

So what you do then, little sister is give this thing a name in your head like 'afsiawuas' or whatevs and go 

`$ docker built -t afsiawuas .`

Dont forgit the dot yo! It's tiny so like, I gotcha back tellin' you to copy and paste it!

What you gotta watch out for, is that Dollah $ign! Dont copy that bro, coz It represent the prompt yo, represents the shell, represent, represent!

So whatcha gotta do now is wait and wait and wait for the docker's dockin', shifting blocks and buildin' lotsa lotsa cool stuff, you know I'm sayin?

When it gets it's shit done, you take down her number liek this:

`$ boot2docker ip` 

And you keep that safe, you'll be callin soon for a date. ( ex: 192.168.1.123 )

So you get dressed first, by runnin

`$ npm install -g bower grunt-cli && bower install && grunt` 

# NB: Run the above command but do _NOT_ run `npm install`!!!! 

Then U start up ur car...

`$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -t -i afsiawuas node /srv/app/server.js`

and drive your google chrome to http://192.168.1.123:8080 or whatever your number was and...

BaaAAAAM! DRAGOUT FILES LIKE A BOSS!
